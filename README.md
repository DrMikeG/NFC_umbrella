```NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF)
The NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) is a standardised data format that can be used to exchange information between any compatible NFC device and another NFC device or tag. The data format consists of NDEF Messages and NDEF Records. The standard is maintained by the NFC Forum and is freely available for consultation but requires accepting a license agreement to download.```


```A variety of manufacturers produce ISO14443A compatible cards or chips, but the most common are based around the Mifare family from NXP. Mifare Classic and Mifare Ultralight are probably the most frequently encountered and useful for basic projects, though many tags with improved security and encryption also exist (Mifare DESFire, etc.). All of the tags sold at adafruit.com are Mifare Classic 1K, meaning that they contains 1K (1024 bytes) of programmable EEPROM memory which can be read and modified in passive mode by the initiator device (the PN532).```
